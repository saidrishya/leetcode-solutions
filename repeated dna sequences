/*
All DNA is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as A, C, G, and T, for example: "ACGAATTCCG". When studying DNA, it is 
sometimes useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.

Write a function to find all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule.

Example:

Input: s = "AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT"

Output: ["AAAAACCCCC", "CCCCCAAAAA"]

class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> findRepeatedDnaSequences(string s) {
        vector<string> res;
        unordered_map<string, int> m;
        int i=0;
        while(i+10 <=s.size()){
            string t = s.substr(i, 10);
            m[t]++; 
            if(m[t] == 2){
                res.push_back(t);
            }
            i++;
        }
return res;
    }
};
